## Getting Started

## Change Log
Task List

Make an Express server. Create a 'proof of life route' to test that everything is in working order.

Deploy your basic-but-working server to Heroku.

Bring in Mongoose. Ensure your local Mongo database is running. Connect to the Mongo database from within your code.

Build a Mongoose 'User' schema with, at a minimum, valid keys for email (a string), and books (an array of BookSchema objects).

Configure the BookSchema to hold name, description, and status.

Use your schema to craft a User model.

Modularize your code by putting your schema and model in its own separate file and requiring them into your server.

Seed your database. Create a user object with your email address, and add some of your favorite books. Be sure to include all available attributes. Add at least three books to your database.

Create a /books route.

When a client sends a GET to the /books route, your server should retrieve all of the books belonging to requesting user from the books database, and return them in the response.
